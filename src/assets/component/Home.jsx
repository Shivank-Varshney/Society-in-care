                            <p>Society building is such a system that any country or civilization takes thousands of years to make. The operation of the social system and the design of its work depends on what and under what circumstances that civilization was born. For building a good and strong society, it is necessary that its framework and functioning should be governed keeping in mind the interests of every class and community living in the society.</p>
                            <p>We (Society in care) strongly believe that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of development, sustainable change will not happen. Following this model of Civic Driven Change, Smile Foundation sensitizes and engages civil society, making it an active partner in all its welfare initiatives.</p>
